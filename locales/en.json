With work experience in big and small companies, which gave me not only programming abilities bug also experience with bigger and smaller projects. After those experiences, I wanted something new and accepted the challenge in a Machine Learning startup, helping them get obstacles out of the way. This turned me in a versatile person, since I had to always learn new things, which I always learn fast. That's why I always like to keep myself up to date, something that keeps my mind fresh."
