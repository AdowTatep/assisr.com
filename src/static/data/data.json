  "description": "Technologist in Systems for the Internet. With work experience on two big companies, Thomson Reuters and Stefanini, which gave me not only programming experience but also helped me to work with bigger projects. After these experiences, I wanted to try something different and accepted a new challenge in a Machine Learning startup, helping them get things out of the way and get it done. This got me versatile since I had to learn lots of new technologies, but I learned them quickly and always like to keep myself up to date, something that keeps my mind fresh and always looking for more things to tackle.",
