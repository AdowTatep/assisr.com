This is the repository for my own personal website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Made with ‚ù§ using Typescript.

I try to keep it up to date with the latest javascript stack. For now it is using:

- React hooks
- Typescript
- Styled components
- Redux
- Redux saga
