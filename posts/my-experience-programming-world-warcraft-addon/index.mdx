I thought this weekend was going to be the same as the previous ones: playing world of warcraft with my friends, leveling my character on the recently released "WoW Classic".

It was Saturday morning, I had just logged in and I was ready to start questing... I was so ready that I wouldn't even bother level up in a Horde zone, the opposing faction that I play against, and where I would probably die a lot.<!-- end -->
